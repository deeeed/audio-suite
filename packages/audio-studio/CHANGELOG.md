# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- iOS `startRecording` now rejects with a specific reason instead of the single message "Failed to start recording.". Six distinct failures — an active phone call, a recording already in progress, missing settings, a failed audio tap, preparation failure, and the audio engine refusing to start — previously collapsed into one string. The codes match the ones Android already emits (`ONGOING_CALL`, `ALREADY_RECORDING`, `FILE_CREATION_FAILED`, `START_FAILED`), so callers switch on one vocabulary rather than one per platform. New `startRecordingErrorCode()` helper and `StartRecordingErrorCode` type narrow an unknown rejection.

## [3.2.1] - 2026-06-20

Stable release of the 3.2.1 beta fixes plus recent release-blocker validation.

### Fixed

- iOS interruption-ended handling now resumes eligible system-paused recordings even when iOS omits interruption options.
- iOS recording preparation/start now fails when hardware exposes an invalid input format instead of installing a synthetic fallback tap that can silently record no buffers.
- Android Expo plugin foreground-only configuration removes recording service and receiver manifest entries when `enableBackgroundAudio` is disabled.
- Max-duration auto-stop uses the normal hook finalization path so `onRecordingStopped(recording, reason)` receives the final recording with retained analysis data.

## [3.2.1-beta.3] - 2026-05-31

### Fixed

- Android Expo plugin foreground-only configuration now removes the recording
  service and receiver manifest entries when `enableBackgroundAudio` is
  disabled. Regenerate native projects with Expo prebuild or rebuild Android
  after changing this option.

## [3.2.1-beta.2] - 2026-05-29

Beta release for validating max-duration recording controls after auto-stop result handling fixes.

### Fixed

- Ensured `autoStopOnMaxDuration` uses the same hook finalization path as manual stop so `onRecordingStopped(recording, reason)` receives the final recording with retained analysis data.
- Preserved immediate `onMaxDurationReached` notifications while exposing `lastRecordingReason` after stop.
- Avoided passing hook-only recording callbacks/options into native start options.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-05-15

Stable release of the progressive long-audio decode API introduced in `3.2.0-beta.1`.

### Added

- `streamAudioData(options, callbacks)` for cross-platform progressive file decoding without materializing full long recordings in memory.
- `getAudioDecodeCapabilities()` for platform decode feature discovery.
- Long-audio validation tooling and playground screen for decode/transcription progress, cancellation, and Moonshine/Sherpa benchmark runs.

### Fixed

- Improved `streamAudioData` parity across iOS, Android, and web for channel defaults, sample-rate handling, range progress, cancellation, chunk sizing, and long-file memory behavior.

## [3.2.0-beta.1] - 2026-05-14

Beta release for client validation of the progressive decode API.

### Added

- `streamAudioData(options, callbacks)` — progressive Float32 file decode for
  long compressed recordings without full-PCM materialization. Supports
  `AbortSignal` cancellation, async `onChunk` back-pressure, target sample
  rate, channel downmix, and stable error codes via the new
  `AudioStreamError` class.
- `getAudioDecodeCapabilities()` for platform feature discovery.
- `validate:stream-long` physical-device harness for CDP/ADB JSONL validation
  of long compressed files, including decode-only, full-buffer control,
  Moonshine-feed, configurable Sherpa ONNX online-ASR, and bounded offline
  Sherpa/Qwen3 segment modes, range-limited short-run comparisons, Android
  memory snapshots, cancellation, stall detection, and pass/fail memory budgets.
- `validate:stream-long` can copy a previously downloaded Sherpa model from
  another debug app sandbox (for example `apps/sherpa-voice`) into the
  playground sandbox via `--stage-sherpa-model-from package:path`, or stage a
  host model directory with `--stage-sherpa-model-host-dir`, making Qwen3
  benchmarking reproducible without re-downloading the ~GB extracted model.
- Sherpa offline segment validation can release/reinitialize ASR between
  segments (`--sherpa-release-between-segments`, defaulted on for Qwen3) to
  reduce retained native heap during long segmented Qwen3 runs.
- `summarize:stream-long` converts `validate:stream-long` JSONL logs into
  Markdown/CSV/JSON benchmark tables for comparing decode-only, Moonshine,
  Sherpa online, and Sherpa/Qwen3 segmented runs.
- Long-fixture Android evidence now includes a full 100-minute Qwen3 offline
  segment run with 30-second segments and ASR release/reinit between segments,
  plus a Moonshine memory-budget failure path that cancels before OOM.
- The long-fixture validation matrix now covers Opus, MP3, and AAC/M4A Android
  decode, with MP3/AAC short Qwen3 decode/transcribe smokes against the same
  100-minute source recording.
- Playground `/long-audio-validation` page and agentic recipe for interactive
  long compressed-audio validation with live progress, cancellation, Moonshine
  model id selection, pasted Sherpa `AsrModelConfig` JSON, and a Qwen3-oriented
  offline segment button.
- iOS: `AVAssetReader`-based decoder with per-`requestId` cancellation.
- Android: `MediaExtractor` + `MediaCodec` decoder with linear resampling that
  preserves continuity across codec buffer boundaries. Codec output-format
  changes (`INFO_OUTPUT_FORMAT_CHANGED`) now feed the resampler so emitted
  chunk timestamps remain accurate when the codec advertises a different
  source rate than the extractor.
- Docs: `docs/STREAM_AUDIO_DATA.md`.

### Fixed

- iOS `extractRawAudioData` no longer traps on non-finite or out-of-range
  decoded samples. Float-to-`Int16`/`Int32` conversion now replaces NaN/Inf
  with `0` and clamps the scaled value into the integer range before
  conversion.
- Web `streamAudioData` now interleaves multi-channel output and defaults the
  target sample rate to the source rate when `targetSampleRate` is omitted,
  matching iOS/Android. `maxChunkBytes` is clamped to a minimum of one frame
  (`channels * 4` bytes) to avoid the previous infinite-zero-chunk loop when
  callers pass a value below the frame size.
- Android `streamAudioData` keeps the active pending buffer after growth so
  the remainder shift never drops samples on the next decode iteration, and
  `content://` inputs delete their cache copy after decode/cancel/error
  instead of leaving a per-stream temp file on disk.
- iOS and Android `OnDestroy` now cancel any in-flight `streamAudioData`
  decoders before module teardown so decoder threads cannot outlive the
  React context and emit events through a destroyed module.
- iOS and Web `streamAudioData` honor `endTimeMs` when `startTimeMs` is
  omitted, treating the missing start as `0` to match Android and the
  documented range contract.
- iOS and Android `streamAudioData` report the decoded _range_ duration in
  the progress/complete payloads (previously the full asset duration), so
  `processedMs / durationMs` is accurate for bounded time ranges across all
  three platforms.
- `streamAudioData` rounds `maxChunkBytes` down to a whole interleaved frame
  (`channels * 4` bytes) on every platform so stereo callers with a tight
  byte cap never split a frame across two chunks.
- iOS `streamAudioData` no longer pays `O(n)` `Array.removeFirst` cost per
  emitted chunk; the pending buffer uses a head-index cursor with periodic
  compaction.
- `streamAudioData` chunk timestamps are now absolute (range start + offset)
  on Web to match iOS/Android, and `onProgress.processedMs` is elapsed time
  within the requested range on every platform so the
  `processedMs / durationMs` fraction stays in `[0, 1]` regardless of
  `startTimeMs`.
- iOS/Android `streamAudioData` event delivery is now gated on the decoder
  still being tracked by the module. Terminal events emitted by a worker
  thread after `OnDestroy` (which clears the map before cancelling) are
  dropped instead of forwarded through a destroyed React context. This also
  survives Expo's `definition()` re-runs because there is no one-way
  shutdown flag.
- Android `streamAudioData` trims encoder pre-roll: when
  `SEEK_TO_CLOSEST_SYNC` lands before the requested `startTimeMs` (common
  for AAC/MP3 sync-frame containers), source-rate frames whose presentation
  time is before `startTimeMs` are dropped before resampling so the first
  emitted sample lines up with the requested start.
- Web `streamAudioData` clamps the `onProgress` fraction to `[0, 1]` so
  resample rounding on the tail chunk never reports `> 1`. iOS and Android
  also emit a final `onProgress` after the tail chunk for parity with the
  `complete` payload.
- iOS `streamAudioData` cancelled `complete` payload now reports the
  requested range duration in `durationMs` (matching Android) instead of
  the elapsed decoded duration; consumers still get the elapsed count via
  `samples` and `chunks`.

## [3.1.1] - 2026-05-08

### Fixed

- Trust Android final decoded PCM metadata for range extraction and trimming, including JS `Number` options bridged as Kotlin `Double`.
- Keep default Android validation deterministic by replacing physical loopback assertions and gating long recorder benchmarks behind an opt-in flag.

### Changed

- Document the playground CDP regression-contract workflow and make optional VAD model loading cache-first.
