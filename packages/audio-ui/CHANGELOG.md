## [Unreleased]


## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-10
### Changed
- feat(audio-ui): improve time range selector dragging ([22c2dbb](https://github.com/deeeed/audiolab/commit/22c2dbbd7463106073ddce8da99cd3244eb586b4))
## [1.0.1] - 2026-05-06
### Added
- `AudioPlayerWidget` and `AudioFilePlayerWidget` for reusable audio playback UI with navigation controls, waveform rendering, and built-in state helpers.
- `ChatRecordWidget` for recording/chat-style audio capture flows.
- `WaveformPreview`, `SilenceTrack`, waveform layout helpers, and decimation utilities for lightweight preview rendering.
- `@siteed/audio-studio` adapter utilities and README examples for the new widget contracts.

### Changed
- Decoupled waveform/UI contracts from app-specific playground code so package consumers can compose the widgets directly.
- Improved audio visualizer gesture/container handling and live mel spectrogram accumulation behavior.
## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-20
- Package renamed from `@siteed/expo-audio-ui` to `@siteed/audio-ui`
- Folder renamed from `packages/expo-audio-ui` to `packages/audio-ui`
- `MelSpectrogramVisualizer` component with Skia canvas rendering and NaN guards
- `useLiveMelSpectrogram` hook for real-time mel frame accumulation during recording
- Optimized mel rendering: single SkImage pixel buffer instead of ~8000 individual Rect components (-36% CPU, -11% peak memory)
- Remove unused `normalization` prop from `MelSpectrogramVisualizer`
- Add missing `@expo/vector-icons` devDependency (fixes TS2307 build warnings)
- Add missing peerDependencies for `react` and `@expo/vector-icons`
- Add `@siteed/publisher` for standardized release workflow
